## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

Hello, I’m Benjamin! I’m a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I’m passionate about all things product design, creative engineering, management and making connections!

Currently, I serve as President of Cornell’s Entertainment Engineering and Design Club (CEED) where we work collaboratively to create fun engineering projects. This past summer, I focused on developing BUDDY, a modular motion-control camera rig.

Through everything technical, I've been able to combine mechanical design, fabrication, and leadership skills in collaborative, hands-on environments. I’m excited to continue growing as an engineer and designer while collaborating with others who share a passion for creating impactful, innovative experiences. Feel free to explore my projects below and reach out!
